This SDK is a wrapper around the native [mx-sdk-php](https://github.com/PeerMeHQ/mx-sdk-php) to enable out-of-the-box support for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) applications.

Additionally, it comes with pre-configured MultiversX API [Network Providers](https://github.com/PeerMeHQ/mx-sdk-php-network-providers) including caching mechanisms using the default Laravel cache driver.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require peerme/mx-sdk-laravel
```

And publish the config file `config/multiversx.php` via

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Peerme\MxLaravel\ServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

## Usage

Since this package wraps & configures the native packages for Laravel, you can access their utitlies without further configurations.

This includes:
- User Login Signature Verification
- MultiversX constants
- Domain Objects
- Blockchain-specific constants
- Other Utitilies & more

For more details, please refer to their documentation:
- Core: [mx-sdk-php](https://github.com/PeerMeHQ/mx-sdk-php)
- Network Providers: [mx-sdk-php-network-providers](https://github.com/PeerMeHQ/mx-sdk-php-network-providers)

### Calling the API

When instantiating the Network Providers, you can decide to optionally cache responses:

```php
use Peerme\MxLaravel\Multiversx;

// retrieve fresh responses each time
$api = Multiversx::api();

// or retrieve cached responses subsequently for 1 hour
$api = Multiversx::apiWithCache(expiresAt: now()->addHour());
```
### Validation Rules

This package exposes the following Laravel [Validation Rules](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/validation#available-validation-rules).

`MxAddressRule` â€“ to validate a given address format:

```php
[
    'address' => ['required', new MxAddressRule],
]
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
